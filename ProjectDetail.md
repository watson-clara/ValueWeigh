## Project Overview

ValueWeigh is a decision-making tool that helps users compare multiple options based on weighted criteria. The application allows users to define custom criteria, assign weights, and evaluate options against these criteria to make data-driven decisions.

## Why I Built This Project

The project was developed to solve the common challenge of making complex decisions with multiple factors. Traditional decision-making methods often lack structure and can be time-consuming. ValueWeigh provides a systematic approach to:

- Break down complex decisions into manageable criteria
- Quantify subjective factors through weighted scoring
- Visualize and compare options objectively
- Save and reuse decision frameworks for similar scenarios

```

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Criterion {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  weight: number;
}

interface Option {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  scores: Record<number, number>;
}

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Technical Questions

1. **Q: How did you handle real-time updates in the application?**
   **A**: I implemented a combination of Vue 3's reactive system and debounced updates. The application uses computed properties for derived data and watchers for side effects. For performance, I added debouncing to input changes and memoization for complex calculations.

   **Industry Terms Explained**:
   - **Reactive System**: A programming paradigm where the UI automatically updates when data changes
   - **Computed Properties**: Cached values that automatically update when their dependencies change
   - **Watchers**: Functions that run when specific data changes
   - **Debouncing**: Limiting the rate at which a function can fire
   - **Memoization**: Caching the results of expensive calculations

2. **Q: What was your approach to state management?**
   **A**: I used Vue 3's Composition API for local state management and created a centralized state system for shared data. This approach provides better type safety, code organization, and reusability compared to traditional Vuex or Pinia.
